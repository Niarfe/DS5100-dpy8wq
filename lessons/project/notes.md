# QUESTIONS
* When you say function should check for array unique and throw value error, is it ok to use assert on len of unique? or do you want a specific try/catch with ValueError on the exception
* When you say nparray can be dtype int or string, do you mean mixed? or one OR the other


# Pandas
```python
df.stack().to_frame('face')
```
